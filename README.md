# Task_1
1.Repository-
It is a place where we can store our codes, files and file history. It is the most basic element of GitHub and it can be local or remote.
<br>
2.Cloning-
Cloning means we are making a copy of the repository in our system.
<br>
3.Forking-
Forking means creating a copy of our repository which allows us to make independent changes without affecting the original repository.
<br>
4.Branch-
Branch is a separate version of our repository. It allows us to work on the different versions of our repository at the same time.
<br>
5.Merge-
It allows us to combine the changes from different branches into a single branch.
<br>
6.Pull Request-
It lets us tell others about the changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository.
